Installing
==========
You will need several system dependencies satisfied in order to have access to `wash`'s full suite of functionality. To check the status of the dependencies, `cd` into `wash`'s root directory and then run:

`rake check:dependencies`

You will then be notified if any dependencies are unmet. (Note that you must _first_ have `ruby`, `rubygems`, and `rake` installed to run the above rake check.)
